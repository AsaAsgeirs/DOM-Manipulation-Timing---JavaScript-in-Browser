DOM Manipulation &amp; Timing - JavaScript in Browser

I styled it with CSS

I added the Animation page scroll bar, but it just worked when I put it in CSS style sheet, but when I was going to write it in JavaScript it disappeared so I kept it in CSS

I added the text Animation at the banner text ,,GroceryList"

I added the clock into the banner.
